Unprovability comes to machine learning. Scenarios have been 
discovered in which it is impossible to prove whether or not 
a machine-learning algorithm could solve a particular problem. 
This finding might have implications for both established and 
future learning algorithms.

We are in the process of writing a book on Mathematics for 
Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical 
concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine 
learning techniques because there are already plenty of books 
doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical 
skills to read those other books.
